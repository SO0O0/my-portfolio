# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post written in Markdown.

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It is easy to write and read. Here are some of its features:

- **Bold text**: Use double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__`.
- *Italic text*: Use single asterisk `*italic*` or single underscore `_italic_`.
- [Links](https://example.com): Use `[text](URL)`.
